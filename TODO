TODO/WISHLIST for Away
----------------------
Email suggestions to away@unbeatenpath.net

- Try to fix this error:

    # cp /foo /path/to/away
    cp: cannot create regular file `away': Text file busy

- See if we can get around having to depend on the setenv() stuff or at
  least consolidate the vars into on single var.

- Possibly add a hook so that the path to a folder with new mail could
  be passed to an external command...then that command could print
  whatever message the user wants to conjure up.  use -e option to do
  this.

- Get code from the vlock program to disallow virtual terminal
  switching...not a priority.

- Designate a signal to allow superuser authentication.  This would
  prevent some luser from locking all of the VTs.  Need to write a set
  of signal handling routines to facilitate this.

- Break up source into more files (help.[ch], mail.[ch], ...)

- Maildir folder support (primarily for systems with qmail)

- gettext i18n support (will need translators, I think)
  http://www.gnu.org/manual/gettext/index.html

- Add non-PAM authentication.  Someone else want to do this?

- Work around pthreads if it's not available

- RPM and DEB packaging data
