TODO/WISHLIST for Away
----------------------
Email suggestions to cameron@unbeatenpath.net

- see if we can get around having to depend on the setenv() stuff.

- Possibly add a hook so that the path to a folder with new mail could
  be passed to an external command...then that command could print
  whatever message the user wants to conjure up.  use -e option to do
  this.

- get code from the vlock program to disallow virtual terminal
  switching...not a priority.

- Designate a signal to allow superuser authentication

- GNU-ize (create a configure script, etc; migrate to /data and /src
  directory structure)

- Break up source into more files (help.[ch], mail.[ch], ...)

- Maildir folder support (primarily for systems with qmail)
