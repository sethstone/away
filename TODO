TODO/WISHLIST for Away
----------------------
Email suggestions to cameron@unbeatenpath.net

- gracefully handle signals (SIGSEGV, etc)

- create -c command line option to specify a different rc file

- create -p and [Persist] option to command line and rc file to allow
  persistent checking of mailboxes.  ie., when mail is found in "foo",
  away continues checking for mail in all other mailboxes.  default to
  yes.

- Possibly add a hook so that the path to a folder with new mail could
  be passed to an external command...then that command could print
  whatever message the user wants to conjure up

- GNU-ize (create a configure script, etc; migrate to /data and /src
  directory structure)

- Make the `make pam-install` smarter (prolly handled by above)

- Maildir folder support (primarily for systems with qmail)
