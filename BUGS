BUG LIST for Away
-----------------
Email bug reports to cameron@unbeatenpath.net

- poorly handle invalid conf files.  use access()

- leak memory if processes are killed

- once a mailbox has new mail, it is forgotten about.  we should
  store timestamps on mailboxes with new mail so we know when a
  mailbox has been *read* (from another shell or whatever).  if the
  file has been read, we can add it back to the list of files t
  check.
