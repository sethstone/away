                            Version 0.9

    Away is a terminal locking program with the additional ability to
    check user-defined mailboxes for new mail.

    Background
    ----------

    Also, like many people (I assume), I always use the `w` command to
    see what people are doing on a server.  I often need to talk with
    someone online, and it drives me bonkers to see them online but
    idle for two+ hours.  Then I'm stuck with the decision of "should I
    wait a few minutes and see if they do something?" or "should I just
    email them since I know they won't be back for another two hours?"
    Well, to combat this problem, I started this project.  My primary
    goal with writing Away was very simple:  write a program to take
    the place of "-bash" (or whatever shell you hold dear to your
    heart) in the `w` command's "WHAT" column.  Since that time, Away
    has been transformed into a pretty nice terminal locking program.
