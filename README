                           -------------          
                            Version 0.9

    Away is a simple program that locks your terminal, checks for new 
    mail in any given number of mailboxes, and lets others know why you 
    are inactive.

    Like many people (I assume), I always use the `w` command to see
    what people are doing on a server.  I often need to talk with
    someone online, and it drives me bonkers to see them online but
    idle for two+ hours.  Then I'm stuck with the decision of "should I
    wait a few minutes and see if they do something?" or "should I just
    email them since I know they won't be back for another two hours?"
    Well, to combat this problem, I started this project.  My primary
    goal with writing Away was very simple:  write a program to take
    the place of "-bash" (or whatever shell you hold dear to your
    heart) in the `w` command's "WHAT" column.

    Away will also notify you if you have new mail.  By default Away
    only checks for mail in a user's $INBOX, but by using the awayrc
    file, a user can configure any given number of mailboxes to be
    checked.

    Away also uses PAM to lock your terminal the way xlock or xlockmore
    locks an X11 session.

    Installation
    ------------

    $ tar zxvf away-x.y.z.tar.gz
      - or -
      tar yxvf away-x.y.z.tar.bz2
      - or -
      tar Ixvf away-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    $ cd away-x.y/
    $ make
    $ su -c "make install"
    $ su -c "make pam-install"

    There's nothing fancy about that pam-install command.  It just
    copies the away.pam file to /etc/pam.d/.  If you have an older
    version of PAM, you may need to add the relevant lines to your
    PAM configuration file manually.


    Configuration
    -------------

    Each user may have an ~/.awayrc configuration file in their home
    directory.  For a description and example of the rc file, see the
    awayrc(5) man page or the awayrc file distributed in this package.


    Usage
    -----

    Once you get Away set up, it is very easy to use.  It accepts as
    many parameters as you want to through at it, and these parameters
    become part of your away message.  For example:

        $ away reading Slashdot
        $ away ...
        $ away playing games

    You may also use the -m operator to make away appear to execute
    as another name, hence removing the "away -m" part of the command.
    For example,

        $ away -m playing games

    will only show "playing games" in the `w` and `ps` output.

    I've also found that symbolic links work great with away.  I used
    to use this a lot before Seth sent me a patch for the -m option.
    If you just want to be lazy and not have to do the -m option for
    the same message all the time, you might like this method:

        $ cd ~/bin
        $ ln -s reading /usr/local/bin/away
        $ reading /.

    For more information, see the away(1) man page.
